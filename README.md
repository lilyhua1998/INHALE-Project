This is for Health assessment across biological length scales for personal pollution exposure and its mitigation (INHALE) Project.

Due to lack of real dataset now, we use the synthetic dataset for now.


This project includes WGAN-GP, DCGAN, Convolutional WGAN-GP, Adversarial Autoencoder models.

# Reference
WGAN-GP code is based on [EllyessB's github](https://github.com/EllyessB/WGAN-Regression.git)

# Supervisor
This project is supervised by Prof. Christopher Pain, Toby Phillips and Prof. Alexandra Porter
