# INHALE Project
## Description

This is for Health assessment across biological length scales for personal pollution exposure and its mitigation (INHALE) Project.

Due to lack of real dataset now, we use the synthetic dataset for now.


This project includes WGAN-GP, DCGAN, Convolutional WGAN-GP, Convolutional Adversarial Autoencoder models.
